Another discord bot, so you can have a look at the way I wrote it.

# Support
You can contact me for support on my [discord server](https://discord.gg/vccpcGfEfF)

# Usage
Rename the `.env-example` file to `.env`. Add your `Bot Token` and `Application ID` - you can find it [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) after you create a bot there. The `GUILD_ID` is an ID of a discord server you want to test the bot.

You need to have `node` and either `npm` or `yarn` installed to run the app.
